Ten (tens across the board)
Nine (lives like a pussycat)
Eight (up all the awards)
Seven (nights a week, can you handle that?)
Six (inch heels, that's why they hatin' on me)
Five (star meals, I keep em' waitin' on me)
Four, (rule number) Three, (never be) Two
'Cause baby you're iconic, let 'em know that you're the (one)
Work
Icon, icon (dance)
Icon, icon (deal?)
Icon, icon (dance)
Icon, icon (tonight)
Icon, icon (dance)
Icon, icon (forever)
Icon, icon (dance)
Icon, icon (for life)
I think it's time for the showdown
If i show up, I'ma show out
Take a seat for the show, now
That bad bitch is the pronoun
Drop, drop, drop-drop d-down low
Queens and queens on the down low
Haters scream at me louder
Y'all just giving me power
They be like, "work sis, you incredible"
I be like, "Thanks bitch, but that ain't enough"
They didn't even know the dance floor was edible
'Til I came up in this bitch and I ate it up
Dance, diva, dance, tonight
Dance, forever, dance, for life
Dance, diva, dance, tonight
Dance, forever, dance, for life
Dance, diva, dance, tonight
Dance, forever, dance, for life
Dance, diva, dance, tonight
Dance, forever, dance, for life
When the bass go "boom" a bitch "boom ka-ka"
Tried to give me the boop, but a bitch bounce back
Bitch still booked, booty still fat
When they say "what bitch are you?" bitch say "that"
Anything you can do, I do in six-inch pumps
Better say "how high?" when a bitch say "jump"
Im a big ol' fag, but I ain't no punk
If you thought I'd lose, then a bitch ain't thunk, period (oh)
Look at her, look at her go (go)
You 'bout to get what you paid for
She 'bout to give you a show (show)
We 'bout to, she 'bout to, they 'bout to
Dance, diva, dance, tonight
Dance, forever, dance, for life
Dance, diva, dance, tonight
Dance, forever, dance, for life
Dance, diva, dance, tonight
Dance, forever, dance, for life
Dance, diva, dance, tonight
Dance, forever, dance, for life
Icon, icon (dance)
Icon, icon (deal?)
Icon, icon (dance)
Icon, icon (tonight)
Icon, icon (dance)
Icon, icon (forever)
Icon, icon (dance)
Icon, icon (for life)
(Work, diva!) Sic 'em
Dance
Fuck it up
What's one plus one? (tonight)
What's two plus two? (for life)
Three minus three? (okay?)
What's four plus four? (bitch, I motherfuckin' ate, rah)

She's an icon, she's a legend, and she is the moment
Now, c'mon now
